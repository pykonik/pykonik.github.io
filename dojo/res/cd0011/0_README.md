Haiku.log Kata - README
-----------------------

This Kata is divided into two parts. First do the *base* part without even
looking at the *backlog*. Once the foundation is ready then move forward to the
list of features.

Focus on developing one thing at a time.

Note that some features may be missing, some may not match others right away.
This is intentional. Feel free to refine that list as you are coding.
