Haiku.log Kata - backlog
------------------------

Once we have the engine tested and running we need to add more features.

They will go roughly in that order:

 - each message gets a permalink / id
 - search by @username - allow to search for messages in which someone mentions
   'username'
 - search by #tag
 - filter by created time
 - pagination - allow fetching last 10 messages and then next 10 and so on
 - share / recommend
 - follow a user so that on your dashboard you will have a list of updates from
   those who you follow
 - conversation (first message starts plain chat - no nested conversations)
 - private messages
 - share via private message
 - reactions to each message / update
 - up and down vote each message
 - users have karma (don't know the algorithm for counting it yet)
 - best messages appear on front page (don't know what *best* means; that
   algorithm needs to be adjustable)
 - URL shortening
 - sharing files (images, videos, and others)
 - make message storage persistent
 - integrations API (no idea yet)
